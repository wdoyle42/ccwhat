## What's a community college? (Seriously)

Federal policy is geared toward free community college. The problem is we
don't know what a community college is. A brief data analysis that asks this question, looking at three different ways of counting and then adding up the number of institutions that meet the definition.

1. Use the IPEDS sector definition
1. Use the carnegie predominant degree approach
1. Does the institution call itself a "community college"
1. Use the proportion of degrees awarded, with a couple of different operationalizations.
